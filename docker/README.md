## Building Docker Images

USER provides a unified Dockerfile for both the math reasoning and embodied images, and can switch between the two images using the `BUILD_TARGET` build argument, which can be `reason` or `embodied-<env>`, where env is the name of the embodied environment (e.g., `maniskill_libero`, `behavior`, `metaworld`, `calvin`).
To build the Docker image, run the following command **in the USER root directory**:

```shell
export BUILD_TARGET=embodied
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile --build-arg BUILD_TARGET=$BUILD_TARGET -t user:$BUILD_TARGET .
```

# Using the Docker Image

The built Docker image contains one or multiple Python virtual environments (venv) in the `/opt/venv` directory, depending on the `BUILD_TARGET`.

Currently, the reasoning image contains one venv named `reason` in `/opt/venv/reason`, while the embodied image contains three venvs named `openvla`, `openvla-oft` and `openpi` in `/opt/venv/`.

To switch to the desired venv, we have a built-in script `switch_env` that can switch among venvs in a single command.

```shell
source switch_env <env_name> # e.g., source switch_env openvla-oft, source switch_env openpi, etc.
```
